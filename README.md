# Face_Mask_Detection

Face Mask Detector utilizing Keras, Tensorflow, MobileNet and OpenCV. We will likewise perceive how to apply this on a
Live Video Camera. With additional upgrades these kinds of models could be incorporated with Web cameras to
recognize and distinguish individuals without masks. The model is exact, and since the MobileNetV2 design is utilized,
it's likewise computationally proficient and hence making it simpler to convey the model to installed frameworks.
